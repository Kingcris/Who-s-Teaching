<h1>What is our Website about?</h1>
<p>The app is like a yelp for teens too bring to or help there own mental state of being because the more someone can relate to you the more help and support you reserve the plain is to show the places that need the diversity to have back round support for someone who has lived thought some of the things that you are living there and having a point that someone can help you to get thought that diffucalt part of your life. </p>
<p>Kids today are wondering why can't there be teachers of their kind in more public school. They feel like on some subjects not all tecahers can relate to. Also it discourages them because they don't even have someone to look up to as their equal.</p>
